# Printf

The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. recoding original printf().

Mainly important thing is understanding `variadics` as because of we can not always know how many arguments will be input to our function.

Hardest part of this project is returning integer as printf orginally return integer value of successfully written things in terminal.  And of course error handling.
